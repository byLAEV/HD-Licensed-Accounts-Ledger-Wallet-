## 0. Executive Summary
0.1 One-paragraph definition of the Wallet/Core  
0.2 Industrial problem addressed (bullets)  
0.3 Key differentiators (bullets)  
0.4 Document scope (included/excluded)  
0.5 Design attribution (by LAEV) and third-party implementation scope (manufacturers/integrators)

## 1. Context and Industrial Problem
1.1 Industry incoherence: centralized internal operations vs decentralized external products  
1.2 Limitations of modern HD wallets for enterprise and institutional adoption  
1.3 Real operational requirements: internal controls, segregation of duties, traceability, auditability, compliance, authorized automation

## 2. Terminology Framework by LAEV
2.1 Protocol parameters (configurable behavior)  
2.2 Normative directives (institutional interpretation and application)  
2.3 Legal contracts (enforceable obligations associated with signatures)  
2.4 Processes (deterministic flows request→approval→execution→closure)  
2.5 Validity conditions (verifiable requirements for acts)  
2.6 Delegated Sovereignty (delegation of the capacity to act without surrendering control of the licensing regime)  
2.7 Glossary: Hash Paper, TUC, ON/OFF, LicenseID, Enterprise Profile, Individual Profile, Device Profile, KeyClass, LeafID, Office, etc.

## 3. Wallet/Core System Vision
3.1 Design principles: minimalism, determinism, inside-out security, evidence-based traceability  
3.2 Related components (no open market):
- e-Bitcoin consensus (license validation/dispatch as a condition)  
- Decentralized Office (administration and referenced storage)  
- Hash Paper (signed case files)  
- Licensed HD Wallet/Core (derivation + enforcement)  
3.3 Governance/operational autonomy and the ability to anchor evidence externally when applicable (without operational dependency)

## 4. High-Level Architecture
4.1 Component diagram: Wallet/Core ↔ API ↔ Consensus ↔ Office  
4.2 Trust boundaries and attack surfaces  
4.3 Data placement: on-chain / evidence-commitments / referenced storage (Office)  
4.4 Verifiable membership: entity/license association without revealing secret material

## 5. Identity, Licensing, Devices, and Delegated Sovereignty Model
5.1 Enterprise Profile (company)  
5.2 Individual Profile (user/official)  
5.3 Device Profile (hardware/software)  
5.4 Delegated Sovereignty: delegation of capacity to act while retaining control of the licensing regime  
5.5 ON/OFF states per entity (company, user, role, device)  
5.6 Enrollment, suspension, revocation, and change traceability via Hash Paper + TUC

## 6. Licensed Deterministic HD: Derivation, Domains, and Parameters
6.1 Entropy: languages and lengths (preference for high entropy) — includes entropy for HD derivation and for license issuance linked to TUC  
6.2 Mandatory passphrase as a non-degradable minimum condition  
6.3 Mandatory hardened: purpose and domain application  
6.4 KeyClass: Money vs Documents/Admin (domain separation)  
6.5 Sector paths (accounting, treasury, HR, administration, etc.)  
6.6 Derivation parameters per entity (company/individual) and operational restrictions  
6.7 Native eUSD/eBTC interaction vs add-on external HD (definition and core perimeter)

## 7. Hash Paper and Case Files: Evidence Model
7.1 Hash Paper structure (metadata, signatures, references, state)  
7.2 Document/storage referencing (verifiable links to the Office)  
7.3 LeafID and case file per identifier (mapping to a binary Merkle tree)  
7.4 Case lifecycle: create → approve → execute → close  
7.5 TUC as the temporal validity framework and temporal precedence order

## 8. Wallet/Core Operational Processes
> Standard format per process: purpose, inputs, validity conditions, required Hash Papers, signatures/quorums, ON/OFF states, evidence, outputs, typical failure modes.

8.1 Onboarding (enterprise and individual)

8.2 License issuance and dispatch by consensus  
8.2.1 Payment settlement and acquisition event recording (omnichannel acquisition)  
8.2.2 LicenseID generation via TUC Block entropy (protocol pulse)  
8.2.3 Validity defined by number of TUC Blocks (start, expiration, renewal)  
8.2.4 License payload encryption and encapsulation/delivery via Hash Paper  
8.2.5 Local/asynchronous validity verification: Hash Paper vs TUC height (no central server)  
8.2.6 Invalidation, alerts, and transition to OFF/Freeze upon expiration or risk condition

8.3 Role/management and permissions via binary structure (org chart)  
8.4 Worker activation/deactivation (ON/OFF)  
8.5 Device change + alerts + conditional blocking  
8.6 Document signing (public/private) with hardened “per event”  
8.7 Treasury/payments: approval and execution as a process (authorized automation)  
8.8 Recovery, rotation, revocation, and Freeze (preventive OFF as a firewall + controlled reactivation)

## 9. Security Parameters and Non-Degradable Validity Conditions
9.1 Non-degradable minima (passphrase, hardened, KeyClass separation, minimum quorums)  
9.2 Configurable parameters (TUC windows, limits, schedules, scopes)  
9.3 Concurrency, precedence, and deterministic conflict resolution between requests  
9.4 Organizational privacy: minimal exposure vs commitments and references

## 10. Hardware USB Wallet Integration (Manufacturers)
10.1 Global adoption rationale (no manufacturing by LAEV)  
10.2 Manufacturer enterprise profile in e-Bitcoin (manufacturer Enterprise Profile)  
10.3 Minimum device requirements: sign Hash Paper; apply licenses and ON/OFF states; enforce KeyClass and paths; control key extraction/use  
10.4 Model/lot enablement and revocation via parameters and processes  
10.5 Compatibility, certification, versioning, and traceability

## 11. Wallet/Core API (Integrators, no open market)
11.1 API as the official channel to publish/query evidence, states, and valid profiles  
11.2 Core objects: licenses, profiles, devices, Hash Papers, ON/OFF states  
11.3 Query of license validity and associated ON/OFF state (for integrators)  
11.4 API guarantees: what it validates and what it does not (responsibility perimeter)  
11.5 Versioning and compatibility

## 12. Use Cases (Wallet/Core)
12.1 Enterprise: treasury and authorized payments with condition-based automation  
12.2 Enterprise: document signing with traceability and role-based accountability  
12.3 Government/institution: official with binary permissions and preventive freeze  
12.4 Manufacturer: hardware USB wallet integration under an enterprise profile  
12.5 Individual user: native eUSD/eBTC + add-on external HD as a standard portfolio wallet (core perimeter)

## 13. Comparison with the State of the Art (Common HD Wallets)
13.1 BIP32/39/44 and standard HD wallet  
13.2 Traditional enterprise multisig and custodians  
13.3 Differences by axis: governance, auditability, validity, adoption, UX, risk, interoperability

## 14. Intellectual Property, Authorship, and Technical Identification Criteria of the Method
14.1 Authorship statement by LAEV  
14.2 Protection scope: method/system/apparatus  
14.3 Technical identification criteria of the method (core):
- license-based ON/OFF validation applied to deterministic HD  
- Hash Paper as a signed case file  
- TUC temporal anchoring  
- KeyClass and domain separation  
- sector paths and delegated sovereignty  
14.4 Third-party implementation: manufacturers and integrators under licensing  
14.5 Development evidence and traceability (hashes/logbooks/timestamps)

- Conclusive synthesis of the Wallet/Core and its institutional scope  
- Final statement of conceptual validity and operational perimeter
